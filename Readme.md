# The Automoblox Redesign - https://musical-klepon-91355f.netlify.app/

# DESCRIPTION

- On your own, design and develop a small web site that features at least five (5) pages each featuring one of the Automoblox® wooden car kits. The site must feature CSS-based layout, interactive, and typographic techniques covered in class.

# INSTRUCTIONS

- Download the Automoblox® images from Blackboard (the .PSD files and a complete set of web-optimized thumbnails and full-size images are included).
- Normalize or reset your CSS properly - this is not needed if you choose to use HTML5 Boilerplate or if you use the Bootstrap framework.
- Structure a complete microsite using valid HTML markup that features at least five (5) of the Automoblox® wooden car kits (you may feature more if you wish).
- Design and implement an effective and appropriate navigation scheme.
- Incorporate the Automoblox® logo, supported by a suitable colour scheme and appropriate font-family choices for the copy.
- Use CSS techniques to arrange either a multi-column or grid-based layout for the page templates (the Bootstrap Grid system is a good choice for this). Make sure that it is suitable for the small screen (mobile), as well as larger formats (desktop).
- Incorporate suitable images, headings and copy (blocks of text may use Lorum Ipsum).
- Build some interesting interactive features based on the techniques you’ve learned in class.
- Post the site on a public Web server.
  Have fun!

# TAKE IT FURTHER

- Attempt a grid-based layout using CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid instead of the Bootstrap Grid System.
- Incorporate some SVG graphics in some interesting way.
- Try incorporating some interesting web fonts with @font-face (and host the font files yourself) instead of just using a Web Font Service (like Google Fonts).
- Leverage some subtle 3D interactive effects somewhere suitable in some part of the interface.
- Anything else you can think of to make the page more fun.

# SUBMITTING YOUR WORK

- Upload the HTML, CSS and any media files to a public Web server and then post a link to the document in the assignment on Blackboard.

# EVALUATION

- You will be graded on how well you followed the assignment instructions from both a technical and a creative perspective, using the rubric associated with this project.
